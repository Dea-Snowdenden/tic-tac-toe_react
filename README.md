This project was done in react. This is the first app that I've done using react and it was based on the React website. It was definitely confusing at first. One has to check different parts of it. It turns out that it that react is basically the view in the MVC model. React is like the UI of an app. Thus studying this is definitely helpful and a lot of fun. 

STEPS:
